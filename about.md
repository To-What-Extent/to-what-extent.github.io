# Who Are We?

We are a group of Princeton Graduate students who are concerned about the promises and claims made by the Princeton Graduate Student Union (PGSU) affiliated with United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE). We believe that the unionization process should be based on truth and transparency. Unfortunately, the PGSU has not been truthful in their promises and claims. This website has been created to provide information to graduate students about PGSU's promises and claims.

We are not affiliated with any political party or movement. The views expressed in this website are solely our own and do not represent the views of any organization or institution that we are affiliated with. All of the materials presented here have been written in consultation with other graduate students who have similar concerns about PGSU's promises and claims.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us at [pu-grads-against-ue[at]gmail.com](mailto:pu-grads-against-ue@gmail.com).
