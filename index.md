# Princeton University Graduate Students Against UE
{: .fs-7 .fw-800 }

To what extent\
... can PGSU achieve their promised benefits?\
... will PGSU push their political agenda?\
... can PGSU actually help you?
{: .fs-6 .fw-500 }

They also conveniently ignore the possible downsides of unionization such as:

*[Politization and polarization of the graduate student body on the current issues.](./ue#ue-politics)\
[Conservative stipend increase that can be lower than the current Princeton rate.](./stipend#conservative-stipend-increases-in-ratified-contracts)\
[Decrease in the number of admitted students given the stagnant grant growth.](./stipend#funding-sources-and-limitations)\
Legal implication and near impossibility of changing the union once it is established.*
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 }

Not sure about PGSU promises or claims?

There is no need to rush into a decision that can have long-lasting consequences. Union election can be held every year, but once the union is established, it is very hard to [decertify](https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/employees/decertification-election).

Early last year, one of us challenged the Princeton Graduate Students United (PGSU) promises and claims which contain rampant misinformation and half-truths, in the published [Daily Princetonian op-ed: Letâ€™s be skeptical of PGSU](https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2023/03/princeton-pgsu-cost-downsides-unionization).

[Read the Original Op-Ed](https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2023/03/princeton-pgsu-cost-downsides-unionization){: .btn }

The conclusion of the article is:

{: .conclusion }
> _... there is no precedent that suggests that PGSU can achieve what it has promised. In fact, unionization may lower expected stipend growth in the long run and use members as pawns in political agendas. The benefits that a union can actually achieve are marginal, at best._
